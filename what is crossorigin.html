State Variables why we use it:

React has no idea what's happening to a variable
 Suppose we have a variable having value 10 and a button which increase its value 
 react has no ides that when we click that button the value of variable should change
 and hence react will never rerender UI So to make this possible we use something called 
 state Variables using useState and other hooks
